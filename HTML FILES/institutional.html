				<h1>Institutional Profile</h1>
				<p>The Judge Kathryn Dufour Law library is a part of the Columbus School of Law, a semi-independent school of the Catholic University of America.  Though it primarily serves the students of the law school, Dufour provides many library services, some of which benefit the broader campus.  Currently, there is not much cooperation between Dufour and the campus’s main library, the John K. Mullen of Denver Library.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="history">Institutional History</a></h2>
				<p> <i>Dates come from Dufour's "A Timeline of the Law School's History"<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup></i> <br>Catholic University, the parent institution of the Columbus School of Law, was founded in 1887 with a charter from the Vatican, and opened in 1888.  Columbus University, which later became the Columbus School of Law, was formed in 1922 by the Knights of Columbus.  Later, in 1956, Columbus University merged into Catholic University, creating the Columbus School of Law.  In 1994, the building that now houses the Law School and the Law Library was opened.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="collections">Dufour Collections</a></h2>
				<p>According to Dufour's website<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup>, the library houses many different collections, including:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A reference collection</li>
					<li>Law Journals</li>
					<li>Government Documents</li>
					<li>Microforms</li>
					<li>Rare Books/Special Collections</li>
					<li>Past Exams</li>
					<li>Foreign & International Law</li>
					<li>State Law Materials</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2><a name="space">Dufour Space</a></h2>
				<p>From Dufour's shelving map<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>: <br> The Dufour library is arranged on three floors.  On the first floor are the law journals, staff offices, circulation desk, and reference room.  On the second floor are the Government Documents, Microforms, Clark Reading Room, and a computer lab.  On the third floor are the Foreign & International Law materials, State Law materials, and 6 student study spaces.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="staff">Staff Profile</a></h2>
				<p><i>For staff listing, please see: </i><a href="https://libguides.law.cua.edu/information/directory">Dufour Staff Directory</a></p>
				<p>The Dufour law library has a fairly small staff, consisting of 11 positions <sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup>.  The primary mission of the Law Library is supported by a staff comprising of 12 members, which is then subdivided into IT services primarily dealing with the information system used by the Library and the Collections services that is prevalent in any academic library such as cataloging, access services, etc.  The Head of Access Services serves the latter role and oversees the personnel in charge of circulation, cataloging, referencing, and interlibrary loans.  The Head of Collection Services is the overseer of the Head of Access Services and serves as the liaison for negotiating between the information system service provider and the Law Library.  The Systems Librarian provides the maintenance on the information system (Sierra) and coordinates with the information system server provider to resolve technical issues and implement any short-term or long-term information technology goals for the library.  Having such a small staff can lead to challenges with time management.  For this reason, it is important for the Library Management System to require as little staff time to manage, and equally important to provide the best level of service possible.  A small staff needs to be augmented with a Library Management system that can provide automation and increase efficiency.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="lawschool">Being a Law School's Library</a></h2>
				<p>Being a law school library can, in some ways, be similar to being any other library.  However, there are a few significant differences.  A law library’s collection proves to be the largest difference, as there are very particular types of materials that a law library requires.  According to Frances Brillantine, the head of access services at DuFour, one of these differences in the collection is the number and type of serials that are required: “Law libraries have got a lot of serials and different kinds of serials.  So, like reports and statutes, looseleaf materials that have to be updated … some of these sets are like a thousand volumes.”<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>  Some of the different types of things that a law library holds in its collection are: reported court opinions, statutes enacted by legislatures, executive and administrative materials, materials from the federal government and state and local governments. Another difference is the way that law research is conducted.  According to Frances Brillantine, most law researchers do not do a lot of browsing and rarely use the catalog.<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>  Instead, the have a list of sources they frequently refer to, which can either simplify or complicate a law librarian’s job, depending on the state of the collection.  A final difference between law libraries and other libraries is the communities which they serve.  In the case of Dufour library, not only do they serve the Columbus School of Law, but they also serve a legal clinic that is ran by law school.<sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup>  This can lead to privacy concerns that other libraries may not have, such as the storage of legal and medical information for active cases.  According to Len Davidson, when considering migration of information onto Google Drive from their shared drive, a consideration had to be made about HIPAA regulations and whether or not this migration violated these rules.</p>
				<h2><a name="government">Governemnt Depository</a></h2>
				<p>A unique feature of the Dufour Law Library is that it is a repository of government documents.  Not only does this influence the content of their collection, as they have a special collection for these government documents, but as a government depository, there are certain rules that Dufour Library has to follow under the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP).  These rules include, but are not limited to<sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup>: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>FDLP Content must be freely available to the public, meaning that public patrons must be granted at least partial access to the library</li>
					<li>Libraries must catalog all current publications that meet the library’s needs</li>
					<li>New items must be processed quickly, as some of the items are time-sensitive</li>
					<li>Libraries must keep retention information</li>
				</ul>
				<h2><a name="goals">Institutional Goals</a></h2>
				<p>Extracting from both the Mission statement section of the Dufour Law Library Collection Development Manual and from the law school’s strategic plan, Dufour Library’s institutional goals are as follows:</p>
				<h3>Short Term</h3>
				Short Term:
				<ul>
					<li>Increase utilization of Library resources<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup></li>
					<li>Expand and improve utilization of technology as part of the learning experience<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup></li>
					<li>Generate and implement a comprehensive public engagement plan<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup></li>
					<li>Explore additional external revenue sources<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup></li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Long Term</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Creating a collection of library materials and resources that supports the research needs of the law school’s programs<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup></li>
					<li>Implementing services, instruction and technology to provide the best access to information and research expertise possible for our users<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup></li>
					<li>Fostering research, education and leadership in law librarianship by supporting staff participation in library professional organizations and mentoring opportunities for successive generations of law librarians<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup></li>
					<li>Supporting our unique Catholic heritage with resources, projects and collection development. We also recognize a special commitment to acquiring materials in law and religion<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Though some of these goals are more broad, a good library management system should be able to assist with a majority of these goals.</p>
