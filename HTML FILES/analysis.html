				<h1>Analysis</h1>				
				<h2><a name="users">User-Based Analysis</a></h2>
				<p>The two interviews conducted have yielded a newfound perspective on how Sierra is used by professional librarians a staff members at Dufour. The following is a conglomeration of both the positive and negative aspects of Sierra.</p>
				<h3>The Positive Attributes</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>The interface of Sierra is very user-friendly and is easy to use by professionals.</li>
				<li>The add-ons used for circulation is very resourceful when used in tandem with the information system.</li>
				<li>Sierra was made to require little to no maintenance.</li>
				<li>The features for creating lists for librarians and IT personnel in Sierra is very streamlined and easy to use, which provides for an overall sense of good functionality.</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>The Negative Attributes</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>The migration from the old servers to the Cloud servers is difficult to undertake as the specialists from Innovative Interfaces have to be onsite to manage the migration process. The migration process can also take a while to complete and hinders professional, faculty, and student use of the server during the migration period.</li>
				<li>The company has expanded and taken on so many new clients since partnering with Dufour that getting service requests is administratively onerous.</li>
				<li>Negotiating contracts with Innovative Interfaces has also become more of a hassle because the company has less of an incentive to make affordable deals even though Dufour has used Innovative Interfaces since 1992 (Millennium). </li>
				<li>The addon that Dufour uses for their Circulation desk has been discontinued by Innovative Interfaces, so the system is a bit dated.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2><a name="heur1">Heuristic Analysis of Sierra</a></h2>
				<p>This heuristic analysis was conducted on Georgetown Library’s instance of Sierra, to which Mullen library staff has access.  It only focuses on the User Management and Circulation functionality, as that is all of the access that is available.</p>
				
				<h3>Visibility of system status</h3>
				<p>There is a large variety of menus and messages that inform the user of system status.  Sierra is very good at informing the user of status through pop-up notices, labels, and highlighting.</p>
				
				<h3>Match Between System and Real World</h3>
				<p>For the main functions of Sierra, the language used to define them matches the expected terms that a library professional would expect.  However, some things within different menus can be confusing (See Recognition vs Recall)</p>
				
				<h3>User Control and Freedom</h3>
				<p>Every menu in the system has a “Cancel” button (e.g. Check out when a patron is selected, patron creation menu, etc.)</p>
				
				<h3>Consistency and Standards</h3>
				<p>Overall, there is consistency in the system.  One example is with user information.  In the user search menu, it includes both the symbol from the user creation menu as well as the actual names.</p>
				
				<h3>Error Prevention</h3>
				<p> </p>
				
				<h3>Recognition vs recall</h3>
				<p> </p>
				
				<h3>Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>
				<p>It is fairly efficient to use, however, off-campus installs sometimes take 10+ minutes to load.</p>
				
				<h3>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
				<p>The aesthetics are fairly decent, although the patron creation window is a bit cluttered, as there are a lot of fields that do not get used and could confuse an operator.</p>
				
				<h3>Error Handling</h3>
				<p>The system gives plenty of messages to inform users of errors.</p>
				
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>There is plenty of documentation on how to use sierra, including a manual accessible from the program itself.  I do not have access to this manual.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="heur2">Heuristic Analysis of Discovery Layer</a></h2>
				
				<h3>Visibility of system status</h3>
				<p>Contains the standard notices of a search engine, e.g. no catalog results found</p>
				
				<h3>Match Between System and Real World</h3>
				<p>Terminology matches the standard library terminology</p>
				
				<h3>User Control and Freedom</h3>
				<p>There are many different facets for the user to control what they are searching for.</p>
				
				<h3>Consistency and Standards</h3>
				<p>The language across the system is consistent.</p>
				
				<h3>Error Prevention</h3>
				<p>Gives data validation for fields that need it such as date.  There are not many other errors to be made</p>
				
				<h3>Recognition vs recall</h3>
				<p>Everything in the system matches the standards for a discovery layer, so recognition is easy</p>
				
				<h3>Flexibility and efficiency of use</h3>
				<p>It is easy to use, and searches do not take a lot of time.  With facets that can be used to refine searches, it should be easy to find what a patron is looking for.</p>
				
				<h3>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design</h3>
				<p>It has very minimalist design, but accomplishes everything that is expected from discovery layer software.</p>
				
				<h3>Error Handling</h3>
				<p>When “No Results Found” appears, it shows tips for searching</p>
				
				<h3>Documentation</h3>
				<p>There is minimal patron-accessible documentation for the discovery layer, though it does provide some recommendations in system dialogue.</p>
