				<h1>Sierra Profile</h1>
				<p>Created in 2011, Sierra is one of the four ILS suites produced by Innovative Interfaces, Inc.  According to our interviews, Dufour Law Library chose Innovative Interfaces because it was popular with law libraries, starting with Millennium in 1992 and then moving to Sierra in 2012-2013.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="innovative">History of Innovative Interfaces</a></h2>
				<p>Innovative Interfaces, Inc. (III) is a privately owned company by HGGC and HMI Equity that offers information systems to libraries around the world. III was originally founded in 1978 by Jerry Kline and Steve Silberstein.  The corporation vends four specific programs: Sierra, Millenium, Polaris, and Virtua.  Below is the current usage for the different systems produced by Innovative Interfaces<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>

				</figure>
				<p>Given the current use of the various systems offered by Innovative Interfaces, we shall now look at the corporate history of III at the time Dufour signed the original contract with III (1992) to the present to note any trends. <b>NOTE: All quotations come from the abstracts on LibraryTechnologyGuide.com's profile of Innovative Interfaces<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>:</b> In 1993, Innovative Interfaces entered the world market launching its software worldwide. The Library Systems Newsletter details that in July of 1993 “The European University Institute's recent installation of the INNOPAC library automation system marks the entry of Innovative Interfaces, Inc., into the European market. Innovative Interfaces systems are now installed in more than 340 libraries in six countries.”<sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>  The emergence into the world market in effect transformed Innovative Interfaces from a small Information System Software Company into global technology giant is today. The rapid succession of new contracts that grew directly from entering the European market would be felt in totality by 1996, a mere 3 years after it launched in Europe and 4 years after Dufour started with Millenium. The Library Systems Newsletter (January 1996) notes, “Innovative Interfaces had a record year in 1995, signing 100 new-name customers during the year, including 11 academic research libraries and 20 public libraries.”<sup><a href="#ref5">[5]</a></sup> In effect adding almost a third of new clients to its company’s portfolio would propel company to both expand horizontally and vertically, hiring new staff to take on new contracts, maintain the existing ones, and further expand the reach of III. By 1997, Innovative Interfaces had acquired a significant share of the European market. Reviewing the Library Systems Newsletter (June 1997), “Innovative Interfaces, Inc., purchased SLS Information Systems of Great Britain. SLS has over 700 installations in Europe, including more than 50 in academic libraries. Its primary product is Libertas. SLS was owned by 16 UK universities. Innovative purchased all of the outstanding stock for cash. The deal includes subsidiaries in Scandinavia (Stockholm) and Spain (Madrid) . SLS currently has a staff of 46 people.”<sup><a href="#ref6">[6]</a></sup>  Innovative Interfaces had reached a new milestone by moving its growing capital to buy-out competitors in Europe in full, making the transition to its system more efficient. However, since the company had by that time more than doubled its reach within a period of 5 years, there eventually would be a shakeup in management in the early 2000s. On October 15, 2001, “Innovative Interfaces announced that Jerry Kline, co-founder and CEO, has reached an agreement to purchase the outstanding shares of the company from co-founder Steve Silberstein.”<sup><a href="#ref7">[7]</a></sup>  From this point on, the company continued to expand.  According to Frances Brillantine[2], all of this expansion and corporate change has caused the company’s level of service to decrease, and the company’s goals have shifted.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="lawlibraries">Popularity Amongst Law Libraries</a></h2>
				<p>Back in 1982, Innovative Interfaces, Inc. released the INNOVAQ library management system.  This system’s “Serials Control Module”, added in 1985, was very popular amongst law libraries due to the nature of their collections.  In our interview with Frances Brillantine<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>, she mentioned the number of different serials, in a large variety of materials, that a law library has to manage.  This Serials Control Module would make managing these easier.  Their history of managing serials was what attracted Dufour Law Library to III in 1992.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup></p>
				
				
				
				<h2><a name="history">History of Sierra</a></h2>
				<p>In 2012-2013, Dufour Law Library adopted the then-new Sierra ILS.  At the time that Sierra was launched, it included “...open source tools and potentially more customizability than [III’s] current Millennium ILS”<sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup>.  These tools and additions made it popular, with 25 libraries signing on as early adopters for the beta in late 2011 <sup><a href="#ref8">[8]</a></sup>.  Among those early adopters was University of Notre Dame Law School and the Lillian Goldman Law Library at Yale Law School.  This makes it easy to see why Dufour upgraded from Millennium to Sierra.  According to Len Davidson, a particular feature attracted Dufour to Sierra: it’s integrations.  At the time of upgrading, Dufour was using a space rental/booking software to manage spaces within the library.  While it operated separately from Millennium, Sierra allowed them to integrate it into the system.<sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup>  This feature allowed for the consolidation of library software.</p>

				<p>The chart below shows the current market share of Sierra, pulled from the information in the Carnegie Classification:</p>
				
				
				
				<h2><a name="features">Main Features</a></h2>
				<p>According to the III site for Sierra<sup><a href="#ref9">[9]</a></sup>, some of the main features of the system are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A web-based application to allow staff to work on any computer, regardless of what software is installed</li>
					<li>Mobile Worklists that enable staff to use their iPhone to manage certain library functions, particularly ones that may involve moving around to access materials</li>
					<li>Numerous APIs from the “Open Library Stack”, a systems architecture developed by III</li>
					<li>Encore Discovery layer, which provides the patron with holdings information</li>
					<li>Their Electronic Resource Management system, which is what originally propelled III to the forefront of the ILS market, particularly for law libraries like DuFour</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Though some of these features are in use by Dufour, some of them have not been available due to the lack of staff time required to configure them.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="addons">Addon Modules</a></h2>
				<p>At the time of adoption, Dufour was given the option to pick four modules to add onto Sierra.  A decision was made to split the modules up, allowing Cataloging/Technical Services to pick two modules and Access Services to pick the other two.  The modules selected by Access Services were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Interlibrary Loan</li>
					<li>Electronic Reserves</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These modules enhance the workflow of Dufour’s staff, enabling them to do things that otherwise would require third-party software such as ILLiad for interlibrary loan.</p>
