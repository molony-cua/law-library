				<h1>Technical Profile</h1>
				<p>Since 2012-2013, Dufour Law Library has utilized Innovative Interfaces’ Sierra ILS.  For information about Sierra, please refer to the entry on Sierra.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="infrastructure">Infrastructure</a></h2>
				<p>As a part of Catholic University of America, Dufour Law Library’s technology infrastructure operates partially under the umbrella of Catholic University’s Technical Services department.  Originally, Dufour Law Library had its own server, on which the ILS and other software was hosted<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>.  However, a few years ago, the ILS was migrated to a virtual server environment hosted by Catholic University’s Technical Services department<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>.  This virtual server is where the ILS is currently housed.</p>
				
				<h2><a name="migration">Migration to III Servers</a></h2>
				<p>Dufour library’s Information Technology staff is currently working with Innovative Interfaces to migrate the ILS from Catholic University to Innovative Interfaces’ server network.<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup>  Having the ILS hosted by Innovative Interfaces could be advantageous, but at the same time there are downsides and special considerations to be made such as privacy and control.  This migration process is taking a lot of time, and will require a few days for the final migration to take place, which makes finding a good time to complete it difficult.</p>
